# Analysis of Oil and Gas Well Production Trends in New York State (2001 - 2022) Using PowerBI

# Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth analysis of oil and gas well production trends in New York State over the period of 2001 to 2022. By utilizing PowerBI, the analysis highlights production volumes for oil, gas, and water, while identifying key geological formations and counties that have been the most productive. The dataset is sourced from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Division of Mineral Resources and covers annual production details for oil, gas, and water at both the state and county levels.

# Objectives
The objectives of this analysis are:

        To explore the total production trends for oil, gas, and water across New York State between 2001 and 2022.
        To analyze production outputs by key geological formations.
        To visualize and identify the top counties for oil and gas production.
        To investigate the correlations between gas, oil, and water production volumes.
        To present a time-based trend analysis of the overall production activities in the state.

# Dataset Information
The dataset used includes production data for oil, gas, and water from wells across New York State, covering the years 2001 to 2022. The fields include:

        Producing Formation: Identifies the geological formations where the wells are located.
        Total Gas Produced (Mcf): The volume of natural gas produced.
        Total Oil Produced (bbl): The volume of oil produced.
        Total Water Produced (bbl): The volume of water produced as part of oil and gas operations.
        Top Producing Counties: Highlights the most productive counties for both gas and oil production.

# Methodology
Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The dataset was imported into PowerBI, and necessary transformations were performed, such as filtering, removing duplicate entries, and handling missing data.

Visualization:
Annual Production Trends: The dashboard provides a clear visualization of gas, oil, and water production trends for each year. This helps to track changes in production over time.
Producing Formations: Bar charts display gas and oil production by key geological formations, giving insights into which formations are yielding the most resources.
Well Performance: A donut chart shows the proportion of gas versus water production, allowing for a quick comparison of resource efficiency.
Top Producing Counties: The bar charts highlight the top five counties for both gas and oil production, with Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties standing out as significant producers.
Correlations between Gas, Oil, and Water Production: A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between gas and oil/water production, showing how these elements correlate across different wells and formations.

# Key Insights
        Gas Production: The Medina formation has been the top-producing formation, contributing significantly to the total gas production with over 5 million Mcf.
        Oil Production: The Bradford & Chipmunk formation leads in oil production, followed by other formations such as Upper Devonian and Glade.
        Top Counties: Chautauqua County is the highest producer of gas, while Cattaraugus County dominates oil production.
        Production Correlations: The scatter plot suggests some correlations between higher gas production and lower oil production, but further investigation may be needed to understand the full relationship with water production.
        Annual Trends: 2021 is highlighted as a year where there were clear disparities in the production of oil, gas, and water, potentially due to external factors affecting operations.

# Tools and Technologies
PowerBI: The primary tool used for data visualization and analysis, featuring interactive dashboards and a variety of visual elements like bar charts, scatter plots, and donut charts to present findings.
Excel: Used for the initial data cleaning and preprocessing stages.

# How to Use the PowerBI Dashboard
Open the PowerBI file.
Use the filters provided to select specific years or producing formations of interest.
Explore the trends in production by interacting with the visual elements like the bar charts, donut chart, and scatter plot.
Review county-level production data to understand which regions have been the most productive.

# Conclusion
This analysis provides key insights into oil, gas, and water production trends across New York State. The visualizations effectively demonstrate production differences by formation and county, highlighting the importance of specific regions and formations in the stateâ€™s energy production landscape. Through this analysis, stakeholders can better understand production trends and optimize future oil and gas exploration efforts.
